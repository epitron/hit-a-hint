# TODO

## Document the key bindings in `options.html`

Ideally, the key bindings should be in a dictionary that can be parsed and overridden easily.

## Remove the need to press "enter" after typing in the link identifier

## 'F' to follow in new tab

## Hit-a-hint should highlight the links with a CSS style

## 'c' to copy a link

## 'a' to show anchors, and 'f'/'c' to follow/copy them

## 'y' to copy current URL

## 'u' to go up a level

## 'v' view source

## 'i' inspector

## 'j' javascript console

## Concern: Am I reimplementing luakit/vimium?
